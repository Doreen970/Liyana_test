# A python application for endpoint testing
This is a python application used to perform tests on a given API endpoint. In this application we have used python framework known as flask
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have a python 3.10 and above installed in your system
## Fork the repository
1. Navigate to the repository then click fork. This will create a copy of the repository in your github account.
2. Go to the copy of your repository then copy the url
3. Go to your terminal or code editor then run git clone followed by the name of the repository
4. Navigate to the repository folder by typing "cd Liyana_test"
5. To get to our python application, type "cd backend"
## Install project dependencies
Write "pip install -r requirements.txt"
This will ensure that you have all the dependencies used in the project
Before running this command ensure you have pip already installed in your system. Note that most modern python versions come preinstalled with pip

## Test the program
To test the program, type "python app.py"
In this case, app.py is the file that contains your flask application
When you run this, the server will start running on your browser
Copy the url address ie http://127.0.0.1:5000 then paste it on your browser
To test your endpoint, add the endpoint name to the end of the url eg http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_test
If the endpoint is working well, you will receive a successful response without any errors
Once you are satisfied with the results, stop the development server by typing CTRL + C
